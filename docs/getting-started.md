# Introduction
The City IoT Operating Platform is a lightweight oneM2M wrapper internally named ctOP designed to enhance interoperability and simplify IoT device integration for smart city deployments. Its aim is to facilitate the creation of smarter, more efficient cities by streamlining the IoT ecosystem. This document is intended for IoT developers, city planners, and those interested in smart city technology.

ctOP serves as an intermediary system providing user authentication and access control for oneM2M-based IoT ecosystems. It offers an intuitive interface for users to manage their IoT devices and network security. ctOP includes the following features that would be incorporated in Phase I. Once deployed, the features can be added, and the module optimized as per the requirements. This ctOP platform may serve as the underlying sensory data layer in any city that can be part of the smart Cities Missionâ€™s City Operations Platform (COP).
