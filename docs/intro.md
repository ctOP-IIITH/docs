# Welcome to the Labyrinth 
> ***Your Unofficial Guide to Surviving IIITH's Dual Degree Program***

**Feeling lost? Drowning in research papers you can't understand? Is your advisor speaking in riddles? Welcome to the norm at IIITH.**

Before you start wondering if your acceptance letter was actually a prank, let's set things straight: You're not alone. Every Dual Degree student before you has navigated this chaos, found their way out of the Vindhya maze, and yes, against all odds, graduated. So, breathe.

This is your unofficial, cheeky guidebook crafted by a bunch of folks who once wore your puzzled expression. They survived, thrived, and left breadcrumbs for you to follow (or at least, they've attempted to).

## What to Expect?

- **The Vindhya Challenge:** Ever tried finding a specific room in Vindhya on your first try? Neither have we. We've got maps, tips, and possibly a compass to help you navigate not just buildings, but the IIITH curriculum, research labs, and more.
- **Advisor Decoder:** Translating advisor-speak into actionable advice is an art. We're here to teach you the basics.
- **Research Rants and Raves:** From finding your research groove to deciphering academic papers, we share the good, the bad, and the ugly of diving into research.
- **Graduation - Not a Myth:** Believe it or not, people do graduate from IIITH's Dual Degree program. We've got insights, timelines, and moral support to guide you to that finish line.
 
## Why This Guide?

Because the official resources, while available, are about as easy to navigate as the Vindhya building. That is to say, not very easy at all. Here, you should be able to find all of your answers - hopefully. Everything's laid out with the clarity and charm that's missing from your typical academic discourse. Our goal? To ensure that the only thing you need to worry about is what kind of coffee will get you through your next study session.

## Cheers to the Assignments Ahead!

Embarking on your Dual Degree journey at IIITH is no small feat. It's chaotic, challenging, and sometimes downright confusing. But it's also exciting, enlightening, and utterly rewarding.

> So, welcome to IIITH - where confusion meets opportunity, and every day is a new puzzle to solve. Let's navigate this adventure together.
